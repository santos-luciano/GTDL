\description{
The data set described in Diggle et.al (2013) refers to an experiment in which 59 epileptic patients
were randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups: treatment (progabide drug) and placebo groups.
The number of seizures experienced by each patient during the baseline period (week eight) and the four consecutive
periods (every two weeks) was recorded. The main goal of this application is to analyze the drug effect with
respect to the placebo. Two dummies covariates are considered in this study; Group which assumes values equal
to 1 if the patient belongs to treatment group and 0 otherwise, and Period which assumes values equal to 1 if the
number of seizures are recorded during the treatment and 0 if are measured in the baseline period. It is taking
into account the Time covariate which represents the number of weeks required for the counting of seizures in each
patient of the placebo and treatment groups.
